I am young, they say, with time to spare, 
But hours slip through thinning air. 
A clock that laughs in silent chime— 
I’m losing things, and mostly: time. 


The days are long, but never wide, 
They close too fast, then run and hide. 
I chase the light, I chase the dream, 
But all I catch is what might’ve been. 


The wins, they flirt and dart away,
Like shadows stretched at end of day. 
And losses pile in quiet stacks, 
A thousand steps on winding tracks. 


They told me youth was painted gold,
But now the edges feel so old.
My hands are full of restless dust, 
Of chances missed and broken trust. 


I should be running, bold and bright, 
But something steals the will to fight. 
And though the world calls out my name, 
I answer slow, and not the same. 


I’m losing time, though barely grown— 
A borrowed life I do not own. 
And every dawn feels more like theft, 
Of all the time and hope that’s left. 


Still, let the stars burn through the black— 
Perhaps there’s strength in looking back. 
For even loss, in youth or pain, 
May plant the seeds of hope again.
